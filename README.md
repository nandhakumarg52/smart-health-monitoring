## ðŸ§­ Vision

To build a **modular, secure, and scalable health platform** that enables:

- Real-time patient monitoring
- Appointment & billing management
- Vitals tracking and health insights
- LLM-powered virtual assistants
- Predictive diagnostics via ML
- Computer vision from camera or imaging input

All services communicate through a central **API Gateway** and follow **microservices architecture** for easy scaling and maintainability.
